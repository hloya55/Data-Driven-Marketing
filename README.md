The project focuses on analyzing ad data from a company to understand its advertising effectiveness on various social media platforms. The dataset provides insights into the demographics of each social media platform's user base, the cost of the ad, the revenue generated, and other relevant metrics.

1. **Understanding Ad Distribution on Social Media Platforms**: Analyze the distribution of ads across different platforms and compare with the CFO's ad strategy.
2. **Effectiveness of Ads by Season**: Investigate if ad effectiveness varies by season.
3. **Platform-wise Profit Analysis**: Determine if mean profits are consistent across all platforms.
4. **New Customer Acquisition and Profit**: Analyze the relationship between acquiring new customers and net profit.
5. **Mobile vs. Desktop Profit Analysis**: Examine if being on a mobile phone affects average profits for each social network platform.
6. **Profit Dependency on Ad Cost and Age**: Understand how profit is influenced by other variables like ad cost and age.
7. **Optimal Ad Spending Strategy**: Given a budget, determine the best way to allocate funds for advertising.
